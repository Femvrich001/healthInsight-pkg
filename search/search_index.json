It helps individuals and researchers assess different aspects of health and wellness using scientifically accepted formulas. Features BMI Calculation - Body Mass Index classification BAI Calculation - Body Adipose Index BSI Calculation - Body Shape Index Total Body Water Calculation Corpulence Index Waist-to-Hip Ratio Mortality Rate Calculations (Perinatal, Maternal, Infant) Birth Rate Calculation Getting Started This package is built using Python and follows object-oriented programming principles. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use for health-related calculations. HealthInsight is available on PyPI, so you can install it using the standard installation methods provided below. Installation To install HealthInsight, ensure you have Python installed (>=3.12) and run: pip install healthinsight Or, if using Poetry: poetry add healthinsight Usage Import the HealthCalc class and use the available static methods for different health calculations. from healthinsight.calculations import HealthCalc Example from healthinsight.calculations import HealthCalc # Calculate BMI bmi_value, category = HealthCalc.bmi(65, 1.70) print(f\"BMI: {bmi_value}, Category: {category}\") # Calculate BAI bai_value = HealthCalc.bai(90, 1.75) print(f\"BAI: {bai_value}\") Contributions Contributions are welcome! To contribute: 1. Fork the repository. 2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix. 3. Commit your changes. 4. Submit a pull request.

Table of Contents BMI (Body Mass Index) BAI (Body Adiposity Index) BSI (Body Shape Index) TBW (Total Body Water) Corpulence Index Waist-to-Hip Ratio Pignet Index Perinatal Mortality Rate Maternal Mortality Ratio Infant Mortality Rate Birth Rate BMI (Body Mass Index) Definition: BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height. Function: HealthCalc.bmi(weight: float, height: float) -> Tuple[float, str] Parameters: - weight (float): Weight in kilograms. - height (float): Height in meters. Returns: - BMI value (float) - Category (str) - e.g., \"Underweight\", \"Normal weight\", \"Overweight\", \"Obese\" Example: bmi_value, category = HealthCalc.bmi(70, 1.75) print(f\"BMI: {bmi_value}, Category: {category}\") BAI (Body Adiposity Index) Definition: BAI estimates body fat percentage based on hip circumference and height. Function: HealthCalc.bai(hip_circumference: float, height: float) -> float Parameters: - hip_circumference (float): Hip circumference in centimeters. - height (float): Height in meters. Returns: - BAI value (float) Example: bai_value = HealthCalc.bai(90, 1.75) print(f\"BAI: {bai_value}\") BSI (Body Shape Index) Definition: BSI evaluates body shape and weight distribution. Function: HealthCalc.bsi(weight: float, height: float, waist_circumference: float) -> float Parameters: - weight (float): Weight in kilograms. - height (float): Height in meters. - waist_circumference (float): Waist circumference in centimeters. Returns: - BSI value (float) Example: bsi_value = HealthCalc.bsi(70, 1.75, 85) print(f\"BSI: {bsi_value}\") TBW (Total Body Water) Definition: Estimates the total amount of water in the body. Function: HealthCalc.tbw(weight: float, age: int, gender: str) -> float Parameters: - weight (float): Weight in kilograms. - age (int): Age in years. - gender (str): \"male\" or \"female\". Returns: - TBW value (float) Example: tbw_value = HealthCalc.tbw(70, 30, \"male\") print(f\"Total Body Water: {tbw_value} L\") Corpulence Index Definition: Measures body mass relative to height.
